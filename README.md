# PyStreamlit

Streamlit lets you turn data scripts into sharable web apps in minutes, not weeks. It's all Python, open-source, and free! And once you've created an app you can use our free sharing platform to deploy, manage, and share your app with the world.

Now, we are going to get comfortable with using Python and Streamlit to build beautiful and interactive web apps with zero web development experience! We are going to load, explore, visualize and interact with data, and generate dashboards in less than 100 lines of Python code! We will accomplish it by completing each task in the project:

- 1: Project Overview and Demo
- 2: Turn Simple Python Scripts into Web Apps
- 3: Load the Motor Vehicle Collisions Data
- 4: Visualize Data on a Map
- 5: Filtering Data and Interactive Tables
- 6: Plot Filtered Data on a 3D Interactive Map
- 7: 3D Interactive Map (continued)
- 8: Charts and Histograms
- 9: Select Data Using Dropdowns
